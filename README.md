# hi, im shantanu

i write code. i've dabbled in approximately every programming language known to humanity and some that probably shouldn't exist (im looking at you msbatch).
currently attempting to pick one and actually get really good at it instead of being "alright"/"good" at seventeen different things.

## things ive used more than 6 times 
js, python, c, java, react native, batch files (dont ask), powershell, c# 

## im picking up 
- springboot (gotta get on that employment grind)

## domains ive worked on
- data science, IoT, webdev, mobile dev, embedded systems

## i write (occasionally), find my posts here
